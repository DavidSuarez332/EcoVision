<h1>EcoVision – Automated Solar Panel Cleanliness Detection</h1>

<p>
EcoVision is a computer vision system designed to automatically classify solar panel images as either
<strong>clean</strong> or <strong>dirty</strong> using a convolutional neural network. Because the efficiency of photovoltaic
(PV) systems drops significantly when panels accumulate dust, debris, or biological matter, automating the
cleanliness detection process can reduce maintenance costs and optimize energy output. This project integrates
deep learning with real-world solar panel imaging to demonstrate a scalable and data-driven inspection pipeline.
</p>

<h2>Problem & Motivation</h2>
<p>
Solar energy production is heavily affected by environmental contaminants such as dust, pollen, bird droppings,
and atmospheric pollution. Studies show that without regular cleaning, solar panels can lose between
<strong>15%–25%</strong> of their annual power output. Traditional inspection methods involve manual visual checks or
scheduled cleaning intervals, both of which are inefficient, labor-intensive, and not aligned with actual dirt
accumulation patterns.
<br><br>
The motivation behind EcoVision is to replace these manual inspections with an automated system capable of
analyzing images captured by drones, mounted cameras, or IoT sensors. With a reliable real-time classifier,
solar farms can intelligently schedule cleaning only when necessary, reducing water usage, lowering operational
costs, and improving power generation efficiency across large-scale installations.
</p>

<h2>Technical Approach (AlexNet)</h2>
<p>
The classification model is based on a modified <strong>AlexNet</strong> architecture, one of the foundational deep learning
models for large-scale image recognition. AlexNet consists of five convolutional layers followed by three fully
connected layers, using ReLU activations and dropout regularization to reduce overfitting. For this project,
the network was adapted to a binary classification problem (clean vs. dirty), and the final softmax layer was
replaced with a two-node output layer.
<br><br>
Images were preprocessed by:
<ul>
    <li>Resizing all inputs to <strong>224 × 224</strong> pixels</li>
    <li>Normalizing pixel intensities to improve gradient stability</li>
    <li>Applying data augmentation: horizontal/vertical flips, rotations, and brightness adjustments</li>
</ul>
These augmentations were critical for improving model generalization, given the variability of outdoor lighting
conditions and surface reflectivity in real solar panel images.
<br><br>
The model was trained for <strong>10–20 epochs</strong> using stochastic gradient descent with momentum. The cross-entropy loss
function measured the error between predicted and true labels, and the training loss consistently decreased,
indicating successful learning of distinguishing features such as dirt streaks, dust patterns, and changes in surface reflectivity.

<h2>Visualizations</h2>
<p>
Below are the key visualizations produced during model training and evaluation. These plots help validate model
performance and diagnose potential issues such as overfitting or class imbalance.

<p>
The loss curve demonstrates how the model improved with each epoch, while the confusion matrix highlights the
relative strengths and weaknesses of the classifier. These visualizations provide a deeper understanding of
how effectively the model learned discriminative features between clean and dirty panels.
</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
The trained AlexNet model achieved an overall accuracy between <strong>85% and 95%</strong> depending on augmentation settings
and train-test splits. The downward-trending loss curve confirms that the model successfully minimized
classification error over time. Most false classifications occurred on borderline examples, such as panels with
partial dirt coverage or shadows that visually resembled debris.
<br><br>
Precision and recall scores also indicated that the model performs reliably in identifying heavily soiled
panels, which is the most operationally important category. The results demonstrate that even with a relatively
simple architecture like AlexNet, significant automated inspection capability can be achieved for solar
maintenance applications.
